#### My-favorite-movie-app
# Developing  a  my  favorite  movie  app  that  store  movie  title, the genre and the ticket sale (as of the due date of this lab, doesn’t need to the exact figure) using SwiftUI. 
Functionalities: 
+ Add : add new movie info object to the dictionary. Ask the user to enter the movie 
  title, the genre and the ticket price. Add need to be a navigation bar button item. 
 
+ Delete : delete a movie object from the dictionary. Ask the use to enter title of the 
  movie to be deleted. Delete need to be a navigation bar button item. 
 
+ Search : search a record in the dictionary. Search is based on the title of the movie. 
  Therefore, your app should ask the user to enter title of the movie to be searched. 
  If  found,  return  the  record  and  display  it  (title,  genre,  and  ticket  price).  Use  the 
  AlertView (study the personInfo examples posted) to read the movie title for the 
  search operation. Search need to be a tool bar button item. 
 
+ Edit: Once the search is done, then users can change the ticket price and genre of 
  the  movie.  Then,  when  the  save  button  is  pressed,  update  the  record  in  the 
  dictionary. Edit need to be a tool bar button item. 
 
+ Navigate  all  the  records  using  next  and  prev  buttons:  Starting  from  the  first  record, 
  next  and  pre  buttons  should  display  one  record  at  a  time.  If  the  last  record  has 
  been fetched and user press the next, display a message saying “No more records”. 
  Similarly, if the pre button is pressed while showing the first record, display the 
  message “Showing the first Record”. Next and Prev need to be a tool bar button 
  items.
